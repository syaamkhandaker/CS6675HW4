# CS 6675 HW 4

## Problem:

I chose to do the second problem for the coding assignment, attempting to create a web server and finding metrics for it.

## How I did it?

I finished this assignment by creating 5 different HTML files with different images. I served each of these HTML files using nginx as my web server. For nginx to work, I had to install the service and update the nginx configuration (nginx.conf) file to point towards my html file directory. By pointing it to the correct one, I can simply just run 'nginx' to start the server and point localhost:8080 to my HTML files. This allows me to point localhost:8080/page1.html to my page1.html file, localhost:8080/page2.html to my page2.html, etc.
